# maps-app
Welcome to the maps-app! This project was built using Mapbox and React (bootstrapped with Vite).

## Project link 
You can view the live version of this project [here](https://location-map.netlify.app/)

If you need a step by step guide to build this project, I documented it in an article. You can check it out using this [link](https://tonie.hashnode.dev/building-a-location-map-app-in-react-using-vite-and-mapbox).
## Getting Started
- Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    https://github.com/Tonie-NG/maps-app.git
    ```
- Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd maps-app
    ```
- Open your terminal and run 
    ```
    npm install
    ``` 
    to install the dependencies used in this project.
 - Configure your env variables by creating a `.env` within the `src` directory and add the following
    ```
    VITE_MAPBOX_KEY = your mapbox api key
    ```
    Replace "your mapbox api key" with your own personal mapbox api key on your account page. You need to sign up to mapbox to have one (Don't worry about costs, it's completely free. Atleast for this project level). You can create an account using [this link](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/)
 - Once you're done, type `npm run dev` and hit enter to get the run the project on your local development server.

## Prerequisites
- You must have nodejs installed
- You need a code editor
